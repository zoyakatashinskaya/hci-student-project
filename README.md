# Parking feature for Google maps (HCI course)
During the Human Computer Interaction course we have developed an extension to Google maps for facilitating parking activity.  
We were working in a team of 6 people. My main role in the team work was coordination of the team and prototyping in figma.

Main result of our project was video presentation.
